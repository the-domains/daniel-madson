Beginnings are always a little awkward, to me at least.  Leaning left and right, back and forth trying to weigh the pros and cons of the information immediately in front of us.  Helplessly struggling to discern some sort of manageable path into the future that is an equal balance of being fruitful and challenging.  Lean to far in one direction and everything falls apart; not far enough and it might get away from you.  This can be applied to a number of things, choosing partners, careers, hobbies, managing emotions, and spending time.  The creation of a new website is nothing new to me.  I've had a few and each has been a tool of which I built in order to present something whether in my teenage years when I blogged about rock climbing and shared photos, or later when I started writing about more meaningful subjects to try and gain some new level of appreciation for the world.  

Of course I didn't set out to fill the internet with my self realizing breakdown of blog posts and world understanding, but rather give myself and opportunity to share photography.  Not just some pictures but well thought out, planned, sculpted, cohesive imagery that has the potential to make the audience feel  something and possibly help a few people along the way.  I hope that what I contribute here is found helpful for many people and that, if inspired, viewers feel encouraged to reach out or speak up about things that I share and whatever else you're passionate about.  I don't want anything to be neglected in my art, I want to explore it all.  I suppose in that sense this will in fact be a self realizing blog of sorts, but my hope is that it will become much more than that.
